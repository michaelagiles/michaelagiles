# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## About me
My name is Michael (he/him) and:
- :man_student: I am a mechanical engineering graduate looking to start a career in software engineering or data science.
- :man_scientist: I have previously processed small datasets for [publication](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijfatigue.2017.07.009).
- :man_technologist: I am currently enhancing my skillset through an [intensive course](https://skills.cogrammar.com/) learning about:
  - Python: pandas, seaborn and sci-kit learn for machine learning
  - SQL
  - git

- :house: I am based in London, UK.

## What am I working on?

- :books: As part of the course I am trying to provide solutions to the [problems that are set](./Portfolio%20Problems/).
- :stopwatch: **Coming Soon:** Data analysis of my commute to work by bicycle, looking for such insights as:
    - Does the weather affect the time taken?
    - Do the school holidays affect the time taken?
    - Can the amount of recent cycling affect performance?


## Who I am outside of Work

In my free time I have a range of interests:

- :curry: Food: In particular I love to try and make Japanese recipes :japan:.
- :bike: Cycling: As well as commuting there are lots of fantastic things to see by bike near me.
- :metal: Music: As an avid metal fan, I go to many gigs and festivals.
- :game_die: Games: There is biannual board games convention which results in two of the highlights of my year. I'm also like video games :video_game: and chess :chess_pawn:. I'll play anything really!
-  :cricket_game: Sport: Similarly, I'll follow most sports :rugby_football:
